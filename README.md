# Mastery Checklist
Mastery Checklist is a full-stack to-do list web application inspired by Luke Blamire's concept of using the sum of two scores to sort tasks based on importance and difficulty. The higher the score, the higher the task will be displayed on the checklist. The app also features a customizable Pomodoro timer. Here is the URL [mastereychecklist.com](https://masterychecklist.com/).
 I have already built a previous version of this project using local storage with fewer features in just normal HTML and javascript.


# About the Website
Mastery Checklist is built using React and Firebase for the backend. The Firebase store is used with its document and collection organization system for saving tasks and Firebase authentication is used for account management.
